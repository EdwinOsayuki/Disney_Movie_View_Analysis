### Disney_Movie_View_Analysis

This repo goes along with my video "Solving real world data science tasks with Python BeautifulSoup!

In this video we scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on Disney movies. 

The video is formatted with tasks for you to try to solve on your own throughout. For the best learning experience, at each task you should pause the video, try the task on your own, and then resume when you want to see how I would solve it.

We cover a wide range of Python & data science topics in this video. They include:
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with Pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
- Working with dates (datetime library)
- Saving & loading data with Pickle library
- Accessing data from an API using Requests library
